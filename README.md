# Smart Attendance

## Overview
Smart Attendance is a system that help lecturers checking attendance at classes.

One day I thought that there is a better way to check attendance that to read every name from a list and wait for 
students response.  

Smart Attendance is based on STM32F407VG/STM32F4DISCOVERY (main operation), RC522 RFID cards reader (reading cards' ID), 
ESP8266 (network connection) and SD card reader (reading network and classroom configuration).

The project uses Flask-based HTTP server to forward read id from STM32F4 to database.

## Tools
### STM32F4
The program for STM32F4 is written in C/C++, built with GCC/G++ compilers and downloaded via OpenOCD.<br>

Base code for STM32F4 was generated by [STM32CubeMX](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubemx.html) (version 5.1).<br>

We were using [JetBrains CLion IDE](https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/) for programming and . The 2019 version of CLion or [plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/10115-openocd--stm32cubemx-support-for-arm-embedded-development) (for older versions) is required.

### Server
HTTP server is Flask-based. It was programmed for Python 3.0 with [JetBrains PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/). It uses database (Microsoft SQL Server) to store data.

## How to run
To run our app you need to download latest release version (current is 1.0), have Python 3.0 installed with all dependencies (look into main.py script file) and use [STM32 ST-Link utility](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stsw-link004.html) to download software to the board (use .hex file fo this).

### Manual
The main purpose was to build card reader that would be very easy to use. Students just have to put their ELS close to the reader and that is it. Users are also given with 4 led indicators to inform about its state:
- green -> ready to use
- orange -> waiting for cards
- blue -> id on card is read and sent to the database
- red -> network configuration failed (need to restart)

Remember that device setup takes few seconds to finish.
